Technology is awesome and can help us solve many problems, including climate change. But stuff like AI can also be misused with very dangerous consequences. Klemen is making this his priority for the #EUelections2019.

I normally enjoy @FareedZakaria's technology segments. But intv today on Chinese AI/data economy was enormously skewed & dangerous. Heralding China as "the future" while failing to raise the dystopian "social credit" system being used to rank Chinese citizens is irresponsible

This is the wrong approach. AI cannot police content effectively and human moderators do not scale. The result will be platforms limiting all but curated speech. Not good. Each of us has a duty to think critically, and then to avoid contributing to hate.

Agree re #AI, #robotics and #disruption. But the term 4th industrial rev is harmful, underestimates the impact. THIS revolution will ultimately prove every tenet of industrialization obsolete. This is why matters like #UBI are more than socialist bs. They▒re a matter of survival.
